<p>Dr. José Dinneny, Professor of Biology at Stanford University and Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, has been investigating root biology since he finished his PhD. His first lab, at the Temasek Lifesciences Laboratory in Singapore, used root systems to uncover the mechanisms different cell types use during stress response, including the roles of non-coding sequences and transcription factors. After a major tsunami in Indonesia ruined agricultural land by seawater floods, Dr. José Dinneny decided to investigate how rice responds to salinity. What he didn’t expect, though, was to uncover a question he would follow for over a decade.</p>

<p>To observe root growth over time, rice seedlings were grown on a clear agar gel. From the primary root growing on the surface of the medium, Dinneny noticed the formation of lateral roots, but only on the side touching the gel. It makes sense: it’s better to grow roots where they can extract water and nutrients, rather than branching off into the air. But how did the roots know?</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>And immediately, it was like, […] ‘why haven’t people described this before? This is very basic, very simple, but very clear.’”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“That gives us inroads to understanding one of the most important stimuli for plants—water—which is also very poorly understood.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus began Dinneny’s fascination with hydropatterning, in which roots develop lateral roots in the direction of water, while regions in dry areas are inhibited from branching. In a paper published in Science this year, his lab discovered that this process is especially relevant in corn, the biggest commodity crop in the US. Modern maize has gone through generations of selective breeding to become the cash crop it is today, and since it was cultivated under agricultural conditions, fields were well-tended with an abundance of water. This means, as features like kernel size and yield were improved, drought tolerance may not have been strongly selected for. As a result, the Dinneny lab discovered that corn’s ability to determine where to grow roots is severely compromised in some breeding lines compared to other grasses that didn’t face similar breeding conditions.</p>

<p>As agriculture demands high quantities of water, making up 70% of global freshwater use, improving corn’s water use efficiency would be a game-changer.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“There may be an opportunity to improve the efficiency in which plants take up water by rescuing hydropatterning in our breeding populations,” Dinneny stated. His newest project aims to induce genetic variation in maize using CRISPR to characterize the importance of hydropatterning in agriculture.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“Ultimately, breeders are only going to look at this trait if they know that it has a relationship to yield and water use efficiency, and the only way we’re going to convince them is to actually do the work, create the mutations, […] and see that plants that have more hydropatterning do better than plants that have less hydropatterning.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the study published in Science led by former postdoc and now scientist at Heritable Agriculture Johannes Scharwies, the Dinneny lab had inspected genetic variation between popular maize lines for hydropatterning-related genes. However, corn is difficult to genetically engineer, so they decided to do a preliminary test in model plant Arabidopsis, in which they knocked out genes related to those identified in maize. By measuring how many branches were formed from the root tissues touching the media, or touching the air, they noticed a reduction in the hydropatterning efficiency in the Arabidopsis mutants. With this data confirming the importance of the selected genes, which regulated pathways including plant hormones such as auxin and ethylene, they are excited to engineer corn next. To fully understand the functions of these genes, they aim to create some mutations that reduce hydropatterning ability, and others that improve it.</p>

<p>In addition to contributing to greater scientific knowledge, Dinneny hopes for his research to make a real difference in the future of agriculture.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“The idea that you can go from, ‘this is a trait that no one has described before,’ to ‘this is a trait that matters for agriculture,’ within my career, would be something that I’d be really proud of.”</p></blockquote>

<p>With a growing population and rapidly changing climate, providing fields with abundant water will become increasingly strenuous on global systems. By fixing the inefficiencies associated with such a prevalent crop, a lot of water can be saved.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“If we identify [hydropatterning and traits like it] and breed for them, I think we’ll be in a better place overall for growing food without destroying our planet at the same time.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Beyond hydropatterning, the Dinneny lab is taking notes from nature by learning from biodiversity. By performing a survey of the anatomy of roots of flowering plants to gauge how they vary across different species, Dinneny hopes to unlock new secrets. There are many plants that aren’t major crops or model organisms, yet still make up a huge part of agriculture. By investigating a wider range of species, the Dinneny lab hopes to characterize organisms that don’t receive as much attention and research, and also possibly discover advantageous traits that can be translated to other crops.</p>

<p>In addition to studying plants themselves, the Dinneny lab has also investigated bacteria that associate with roots, including Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Bt is the bacterium that makes the most common biological pesticide, yet the mechanisms that determine its association with plants remain largely uncharacterized. PhD students Kevin Shih and Carin Ragland in the Dinneny lab discovered that Bt hitches a ride at the tip of a root, allowing it to colonize the root as it grows. As cells sluff off the root cap as it pushes through soil, some of the bacteria are brought along, where they can live on the mature root. Advancing the understanding of the relationship between root cap development and bacterial colonization opens the door for improving this system even beyond insecticide applications, such as engineering B. thuringiensis to synthesize useful plant hormones or increase bacterial populations through interactions with the root cap.</p>

<p>Looking at plant systems through multiple different lenses helps the Dinneny lab see the bigger picture, including not just how roots develop and function, but how they vary across species and interact with their environment. This comprehensive view contributes not only to the scientific understanding of biological systems, but also how they can be harnessed to make a more sustainable future.</p>

<h2>Career Journey</h2>
<p>Excited about the seemingly infinite potential of agricultural biotechnology, Dinneny had chosen to study Genetics &amp; Plant Biology during his undergraduate degree at UC Berkeley. The budding field was optimistic, buzzing with novel ideas for revolutionizing plant systems, and Dinneny was eager to contribute to it.</p>

<p>His first foray into research was in the lab of Dr. Robert Fischer, who had identified mutants that were able to perform partial apomixis, the generation of seeds without fertilization. In nature, fertilization is desirable because it increases genetic diversity, but in agriculture, a line that has been bred to maximize yield will lose its desirable traits by crossing with other lines. With apomixis, clones could be planted by seed.</p>

<p>Dinneny learned, as many early scientists do, that research is not for the faint of heart. Protocols contain no room for error, and even when followed perfectly, results are never guaranteed.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>“There were days where I thought, ‘this is just not for me. I can’t take this much failure.’ But I stuck with it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>By the end of his junior year, Dinneny had completed a mutant screen and cloned a gene, both significant tasks, especially before the turn of the century. With newfound confidence following the success of his undergraduate research, Dinneny was excited to enter graduate school to study flower development and morphology. After finishing his PhD, Dinneny chose to study roots, as they serve as a useful model for understanding the function of different cell types. Roots are like onions, composed of layers of different cell types wrapped around the circumference, each with different functions, able to filter out the harmful materials whilst letting in advantageous ones. Still intrigued with development, Dinneny was curious about how different cell types are created, and the genes related to the differing functions between types.</p>

<p>To analyze different cell types, however, they needed to be sorted from the root tissue. This was achieved by breaking the tissue down into individual cells and marking genes affiliated with specific cell types using a fluorescent protein. This could then be filtered using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), that picks out the fluorescent cells. From there, they could analyze for the genes being activated in different types, along with how they reacted to environmental stress. Dinneny developed a tissue-specific map of environmental stress response in plants using salinity, research that would prepare him for starting his own lab.</p>

<p>It was fascinating to learn about Dr. Dinneny’s journey and the projects going on in his lab, and I’m excited to learn more! It is shocking that hydropatterning had been largely uninvestigated prior to the work of the Dinneny lab, especially considering its immense implications on corn. It is difficult, at this stage, to find realistic implementations of genetic manipulation, as regulations and upfront investments prevent beneficial adjustments from reaching farmers. However, water use is both a financial and environmental concern, possibly warranting biotechnological adjustment. This is the sort of innovation I hope to contribute to in research.</p>

<p>It was also inspiring to hear about Dr. Dinneny’s journey in research and his struggles as an undergraduate. People talk about the challenges of research all the time, but it’s easy to interpret failures as a reflection of one’s work or abilities, rather than the nature of this field. When your project isn’t making progress, it can blur your vision of the future. It is motivational to be reminded how even accomplished researchers battled with frustration and uncertainty early in their careers.</p>

<p>As always, I learn with each article how vast the world of biotechnology is: how things I’ve never heard of are being uncovered and engineered to advance our knowledge and abilities as a species. I can’t wait to learn more, so stay tuned to learn with me!</p>
