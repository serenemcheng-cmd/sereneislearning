                <p>There are many obstacles to the implementation of superhot rock energy, the theoretical energy source pioneered by the Clean Air Task Force (CATF), which promises to produce renewable energy in high quantities anywhere at anytime. Superhot rock is a relatively new concept with high upfront costs with relatively little funding from both public and private investors, preventing it from advancing at a quick pace. CATF argues that donations from environmentally conscious givers is the prime way to foster its development at this early stage. CATF explains that the energy industry is unlikely to invest money into superhot rock energy while research is in its infancy, as growth in new technology tends to start slow and gradually ramps up until it reaches an inflection point. Until that point is reached, private investors are unlikely to spend their money on development, which is why funding from donations is so meaningful. This is further amplified by the high investment costs, as knowledge of the Earth’s subsurface is extremely lacking, warranting further research and therefore the employment of experts. Additionally, the first superhot rock well is estimated to cost several million dollars. In contrast, solar can be operated on a small scale and a single cell can be operated for a few thousand dollars, making it an easier pill to swallow for investors.</p>
<p>Funds from philanthropy are so desperately needed for the development of superhot rock energy because the time, costs, and risk associated with superhot rock make governments hesitant and almost completely block private investors from the picture. Private investors spend money with their own profits in mind, and therefore seek safe payouts that will return within a reasonable fraction of their lifetime. Governments, though, invest on a nation-wide scale, tolerating significantly higher costs and allowing more time, but they will not pursue a costly and theoretical energy source unprompted. </p>
<p>CATF argues that investing in policy experts is a cost-effective way to spur development of superhot rock energy, as they can research and compile convincing evidence to encourage government officials to sponsor development of the energy source. They claim that their reputation as honest and determined experts allow them to persuade those in positions of power to listen, making charity to their organization an extremely efficient use of funds for superhot rock. CATF supports this by noting that their policy experts played a role in the DOE’s agreement to invest $5-25 million on the first superhot rock energy demonstration in the US, which was made possible with a few thousand dollars in donations. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, most knowledge about superhot rock gained by private investors is locked away to keep ahead of other researchers, but that just leaves every party with less information, extending the amount of time and money needed for development. CATF works with these companies and compiles their research to promote the industry, without giving away their progress to their competitors. </p>
<p>In a time where the world is under the most pressure to phase out fossil fuels, the sooner alternative energy sources such as superhot rock are investigated, the better. The Princeton ZERO Lab estimates that our global demand for power will double in the next two and a half decades, which CATF implied is a conservative estimate considering the unforeseen impact of AI and “increasing water crises.”</p>
<p>CATF urges its audience to consider what the best investments for energy sources will be on the scope of several generations. Solar and wind farms are certainly a step up from fossil fuels, but are they strong enough to support human populations for multiple centuries? It is gratifying to see gradual improvement because changes, although smaller, happen more quickly, but making higher quality investments can be more efficient and last longer, resulting in a much better return for the money spent.</p>
<p>I wrote this article over summer, as I prepped some posts in advance to account for my heavy load this semester, and the points I featured here from CATF’s website have definitely stuck with me. I hadn’t really thought about how important it was for experts to collect information and pitch projects like these that involve expensive technology, but it makes sense. Why would you spend your money on an idea that has very little substance? And that includes how governments are the most likely to engage, as they have to think in the long-term, but individuals need more immediate payoff because they have bills to pay and don’t really care if the industry is going to take off by the time they’re in the ground. Not to say the superhot rock won’t, but to be fair, nobody really knows.</p>
<p>Something else this made me think about is how all of these competing companies are being inefficient by the redundancies of their research, and how that makes a lose-lose scenario. Either everyone wastes time and resources reinventing the wheel or everyone sits around waiting for other people to do the work and nothing happens. That’s why CATF’s intervention is so crucial; they can collaborate without sacrificing their advantage in a capitalistic economy.</p>
<p>Anyway, kind of cool to be able to reflect on a post, even though it’s new to you guys. Stay tuned to learn with me!</p>
