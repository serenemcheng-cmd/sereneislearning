<p>Most plants reproduce via sexual reproduction, combining genetic material from two parents to form a seed that grows into a new plant. While this strategy increases genetic diversity, it also creates challenges for farmers who want to maintain desirable traits from one generation to the next. In contrast, apomixis is a form of asexual reproduction in plants that produces seeds genetically identical to the parent plant, bypassing the usual sexual process. This means offspring are true clones of their mother plant, preserving specific traits across generations without the need for cross-breeding.</p>

<p>In classic apple breeding, for example, genetic recombination during sexual reproduction makes it nearly impossible to grow an identical copy of a favored variety from seed, so growers must use vegetative propagation like grafting. In contrast, plants that naturally perform apomixis form seeds by mitosis rather than meiosis, making each seed a genetic duplicate of its parent. If this trait could be brought into major crops, farmers could reliably grow exact copies of high-performing plants year after year without needing hybrid seed production.</p>

<p>Some plants do reproduce asexually through self-pollination or true-breeding lines where parents are genetically homozygous, meaning their offspring are uniform. However, this differs from true apomixis, which produces genetically identical offspring even when parents are not fully homozygous. Apomixis holds particular interest in agriculture because it could fix hybrid vigor — the increased performance seen in hybrid crops — and allow those desirable traits to be maintained over many generations without repeated crossing.</p>

<p>Although apomixis does not occur naturally in most major food crops, scientists have made strides toward engineering this process. One strategy involves creating a “Mitosis instead of Meiosis (MiMe)” phenotype by mutating key genes that control meiotic division so that meiosis is replaced with mitosis. Combined with methods to initiate embryogenesis without fertilization, such as expressing embryogenesis-triggering genes, researchers have demonstrated synthetic apomixis in crops like sorghum and rice. This research illustrates how bypassing meiosis and inducing parthenogenesis — the formation of an embryo without fertilization — can potentially lead to clonal seed production in important food crops.</p>

<p>If successfully deployed in agriculture, apomixis could transform plant breeding by fixing desirable traits, reducing breeding time and costs, and giving farmers more autonomy over seed production. As research continues, innovations in genetic engineering and developmental biology are bringing us closer to a future where “clonal seeds” may be a practical tool for global crop improvement.</p>
