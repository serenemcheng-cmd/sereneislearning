                <p>Almonds are among the most popular nuts, due in part to the wide range of nutritional benefits they provide. They have been referred to as a “superfood” due to their fiber, protein, healthy fat, and vitamin E content, and studies show that almonds can improve cardiovascular health. A study conducted by Aston University compared data between a group that ate their typical diet and a group that ate 50 grams of almonds daily, and found that the latter group had elevated antioxidant levels and lower blood pressure, which lowers the risk of heart disease. </p>
<p>However, as with any aspect of consumption, it is important to pay attention to the impact of their production. Almonds are known for their water usage, though estimates range from 1.1 to 3.2 gallons per kernel (Fulton et al.). This is especially relevant in California, where most of the world’s almonds are produced. There are a few factors that contribute to the amount of water that almond farming requires, including high transpiration rates and how the nut develops<strong>.</strong> Almond trees are typically not harvested from until a few years after their planted, and unlike many other crops, they must be watered year-round. Some other plants can be left fallow until production resumes, reducing water use in other seasons.</p>
<p>Many people believe that almond products, namely almond milk, are not a good choice because of water usage, but the “normal” option sometimes uses even more resources than almonds. As has been discussed in <a href="https://sereneislearning.wordpress.com/2023/04/09/milks-dairy-vs-plant-based-serenes-synopsis-31/">a previous Synopsis</a>, in the case of almond milk, cow’s milk actually requires 69% more water to produce (Ritchie). This is partially due to the fact that almond milk contains very little almonds. Almond milk contains thickeners, sweeteners, and nutritional additives, and almonds sometimes make up only 2% of the beverage (Szalay). </p>
<p>In terms of carbon emissions, research has shown that almonds produce one kilogram of emissions per kilogram of product, beating out beans and vegetables, which have a ratio of two to one emissions per product by mass. They blow beef way out of the water, which produces 20 kg (Dennehy). Almonds’ relatively low GHG production rates are due in part to the fact that biomass such as leaves and shells are repurposed as animal feed or burned for electricity. This use of almond byproducts decreases the production, and therefore water usage, of other crops, which is important to consider when discussing almonds’ impact on water systems.</p>
<p>There are several factors at play when it comes to making dietary decisions, and there’s no single answer that solves every problem for everyone. Especially when it comes to food, it is important to supplement from a diverse mix, as each item offers a different selection of nutrients. Almonds are nutritionally strong, but their high water usage is less than ideal, so they should not be solely relied upon as a superfood. That being said, their long shelf life make them less wasteful than some perishable protein sources that might not be eaten in time. As well as water use, many are concerned with the application of pesticides on almonds and the resulting damage to bee populations, which almond trees rely on to survive. Making the best choice for environment, diet, and preference is not simple, and it is crucial to remember that every option available is nuanced.</p>
<p>It isn’t often that I write a Synopsis without a strong opinion on the subject, but that is the case this week. I love almonds, but I’m not particularly attached to them, as there are plenty of other nuts I enjoy. I’ve heard a lot about the water usage of almonds, and after listening to a “Skeptical Sunday” podcast episode about them, I decided to look into them a little further. What I found was a lot of information that pointed in every direction and reminded me that there aren’t any simple answers, especially with food. We need to eat a bunch of different things, and all of them offer different attributes. Almonds aren’t unforgiveably horrible, but they’re not perfect. The same goes for most foods.</p>
<p>I was quite dismayed to find that there hasn’t been a lot of research, or at least successful research, on using genetic engineering to decrease almonds’ water consumption. I was hoping to find a bunch of articles on progress being made in that field, which would be great for the future of almonds, but I found very little. There was one article I found that seemed promising, but I don’t have access to it. I filled out some forms to request access, so if I’m granted it, I’ll let you know! Stay tuned to learn with me!</p>
