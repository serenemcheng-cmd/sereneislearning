                <p>One of the most popular and easy swaps consumers make to reduce their waste is replacing plastic grocery bags, whether it be with cotton totes, paper bags, or other alternatives. Buying and throwing out a cart full of plastic shopping bags every time someone goes shopping is not necessary, and adds up to a lot of plastic waste, which is why policy has been implemented to decrease the use of single-use plastic bags. In most regions, it started with a fee on disposable bags to discourage their use, but many states have adopted a ban on single-use plastic bags altogether. However, before consumers run to buy a variety of bags marketed for sustainability, they should actually consider using plastic bags instead.</p>
<p>The battle between paper and plastic bags is not as simple as it is often painted. Although usually considered more environmentally-friendly, paper bags are actually more energy-intensive than plastic bags to produce. They require four times the energy to produce as disposable plastic bags, though they are compostable and more easily recycled. That being said, there is a limit to how many times paper can be recycled, and it is estimated that to reach the same level as plastic, paper bags would have to be reused somewhere between three and 43 times. Single-use plastic bags are actually the most eco-friendly to produce. The disposable plastic bags found at the end of grocery store aisles are typically made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and though it is typically made with materials like petroleum, its production leads to less waste, warming emissions, and other products associated with the manufacturing of other popular bag materials. Additionally, thicker bags can be reused multiple times and be repurposed as a trash bag or recycled. However, plastic bags take many years to decompose, and in the meantime, can harm marine life or contribute to litter, then turn into microplastics.</p>
<p>Reusable bags are the best stuff-carrying option when it comes to the environment, but the different materials they can be made of result in very different impacts. Cotton bags were quickly equipped by environmentalists, but cotton is actually extremely resource-intensive, warranting reuse of possibly thousands of times to equate with the impact of plastic bags. While cotton bags are sturdy, washable, and biodegradable, they are not the best option because of the effects of their production. Fortunately, there are reusable options that are durable and have a much lower environmental footprint. Nonwoven polypropylene (PP), a sturdy material that feels like fabric made of plastic, only needs to be reused about eleven times to level out with conventional plastic bags. Bags made of nonwoven PP are extremely durable and are easily printed on with various designs and logos, making them attractive to consumers and ideal for brands. </p>
<p>No matter what, reusing bags is better than buying new ones. Although some bags are more environmentally friendly than others, buying shopping bags secondhand is the most sustainable option. Bags can even be made from repurposed fabrics, such as torn or stained denim, to upcycle materials that might otherwise be thrown away. </p>
<p>For most places, the ban on all disposable plastic bags resulted in stores providing thicker plastic bags that could be used several dozen times. Unfortunately, they remained at the same price point (around a dime) of the thin plastic bags they replaced, and as a result, customers weren’t motivated to change their habits. Most of my family continues to buy brand new plastic bags every time they visit the store, despite their durability and cost, albeit small. I know habits can be hard for people to break, but it’s so easy to leave plastic bags in the car to take out whenever you go to the grocery store. For my family, I think the only way that they would start reusing bags is if they were priced closer to a dollar. My dad even buys a ton of them on purpose when he hosts parties so that he can give out leftovers to his clients. If plastic bags had a higher cost, most consumers would feel a stronger pressure to make more sustainable choices, regardless of their concern for the environment. Human civilization existed for a long time before plastic manufacturing, and I have no doubt that society would function just fine with greater motivation.</p>
<p>I don’t think that this is possible, though, without policy. Grocery stores have little incentive to make shopping bags any more expensive, as they encourage shoppers to buy more, which is why they were offered free to begin with. The most effective way to address this issue is to make a case for increasing fees on plastic bags and support those that listen to us. This gives power to those that advocate for the environment and encourages others to do the same.</p>
