    <p>
      Dr. José Dinneny, Professor of Biology at Stanford University and Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, has been investigating root biology since he finished his PhD. His first lab, at the Temasek Lifesciences Laboratory in Singapore, used root systems to uncover the mechanisms different cell types use during stress response, including the roles of non-coding sequences and transcription factors.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a major tsunami in Indonesia ruined agricultural land by seawater floods, Dinneny decided to investigate how rice responds to salinity. What he didn’t expect, though, was to uncover a question he would follow for over a decade.
    </p>

    <p>
      To observe root growth over time, rice seedlings were grown on a clear agar gel. From the primary root growing on the surface of the medium, Dinneny noticed the formation of lateral roots — but only on the side touching the gel.
    </p>

    <p>
      It makes sense: it’s better to grow roots where they can extract water and nutrients, rather than branching off into the air. But how did the roots know?
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Why haven’t people described this before? This is very basic, very simple, but very clear.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “That gives us inroads to understanding one of the most important stimuli for plants — water — which is also very poorly understood.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Thus began Dinneny’s fascination with hydropatterning, in which roots develop lateral roots in the direction of water, while regions in dry areas are inhibited from branching.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a paper published in <em>Science</em>, his lab discovered that this process is especially relevant in corn, the biggest commodity crop in the United States. Modern maize has gone through generations of selective breeding under agricultural conditions with abundant water, meaning drought tolerance may not have been strongly selected for.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, the Dinneny lab discovered that corn’s ability to determine where to grow roots is severely compromised in some breeding lines compared to other grasses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Agriculture accounts for roughly 70% of global freshwater use. Improving corn’s water use efficiency would therefore be a game-changer.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “There may be an opportunity to improve the efficiency in which plants take up water by rescuing hydropatterning in our breeding populations.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      His newest project aims to induce genetic variation in maize using CRISPR to characterize the importance of hydropatterning in agriculture.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Ultimately, breeders are only going to look at this trait if they know that it has a relationship to yield and water use efficiency.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      To validate these findings, the lab first tested candidate genes in Arabidopsis, knocking out genes associated with hydropatterning. Mutants showed reduced directional root branching, confirming the importance of these pathways — many involving hormones such as auxin and ethylene.
    </p>

    <p>
      With this confirmation, the lab is now excited to engineer corn lines that either enhance or reduce hydropatterning ability to fully understand the trait’s agricultural impact.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “The idea that you can go from ‘this is a trait that no one has described before’ to ‘this is a trait that matters for agriculture’ within my career would be something that I’d be really proud of.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Beyond hydropatterning, the Dinneny lab studies biodiversity across flowering plants, hoping to identify under-studied species with advantageous traits that could be translated to crops.
    </p>

    <p>
      The lab also investigates bacteria associated with roots, including <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>. They discovered that Bt colonizes roots by hitching a ride on sloughing root cap cells — a finding that could open doors beyond insecticide applications, such as engineering bacteria to synthesize beneficial plant hormones.
    </p>

    <h2>Career Journey</h2>

    <p>
      Dinneny studied Genetics and Plant Biology at UC Berkeley, entering a field buzzing with optimism for agricultural biotechnology.
    </p>

    <p>
      His early research involved apomixis — seed formation without fertilization — a concept that could allow farmers to plant high-yield clones by seed.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “There were days where I thought, ‘this is just not for me. I can’t take this much failure.’ But I stuck with it.”
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      That perseverance paid off. By developing cell-type-specific stress response maps using FACS and fluorescent markers, Dinneny laid the groundwork for his future lab and its focus on root systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Learning about Dinneny’s journey was deeply motivating. Hydropatterning had been largely unexplored despite its implications, reminding me how many transformative discoveries still lie hidden in plain sight.
