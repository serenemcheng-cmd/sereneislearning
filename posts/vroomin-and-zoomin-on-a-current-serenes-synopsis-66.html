                <p>The greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth’s atmosphere have been accumulating at an accelerated rate in the past few centuries, causing an appropriately-named greenhouse effect that amplifies the speed at which the temperature of the planet increases. This is mostly due to anthropogenic reasons, and time has been ticking to reduce the emissions of GHGs before the effects of global warming turn catastrophic. Fortunately, more people are aware of climate change than ever, and as a result, there is a widespread interest in decreasing the amount of emissions people produce from their diets, clothes, and transportation. Transportation made up more than 22% of worldwide emissions in 2019, as most methods of transportation involve the combustion of fuel, which releases carbon dioxide, one of the gases that traps heat within the Earth’s atmosphere (CO₂ emissions from transport). Concern about global warming has motivated people to reevalute transportation methods, and there has been a demand for vehicles that produce less GHGs, such as electric vehicles. Electric vehicles store energy in batteries and use that to propel the car forward instead of producing energy from the combustion of fuel, so they don’t contribute to global warming as much as traditional cars with an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>Most electric cars are charged in garages overnight and use electricity instead of gasoline to power movement. This results in no tailpipe emissions, but the extent of its friendliness to the environment depends on how the electricity is generated, which varies by region. Electricity generated through clean sources such as solar, wind, and nuclear, will have a drastically lower carbon footprint than electricity generated by the combustion of fossil fuels. Generating one kilowatt-hour of electricity produces an estimated equivalent of 820 grams of CO2 from burning coal, while solar and nuclear only produce 41-48 and 12 grams respectively (Carbon Dioxide Emissions From Electricity). Using electricity to charge a car in an area that depends primarily on fossil fuels contributes more to global warming than charging a car with clean energy. That being said, even power plants that burn fossil fuels are more efficient than car engines, because when power is generated from combustion, energy is lost to heat, and more energy is lost as surface area increases, so a single large generator in a power plant loses less heat than multiple individual smaller car engines. The ability for energy to be used efficiently is a major factor in why electric cars are viewed as more environmentally friendly, as only 16-25% of the energy generated by car engines is used to move the wheels and move the car forward (Where the Energy Goes: Gasoline Vehicles). Meanwhile, in electric cars, 87-91% of electricity consumed is spent on moving the wheels, which is partially due to the fact that when the car brakes, energy is regenerated, whereas in normal cars, momentum lost from braking is entirely converted into heat (Where the Energy Goes: Electric Cars). One of the main reasons electric cars are supported as a solution to climate change is because of how much more efficient they are at converting energy into motion, and higher efficiency results in fewer GHG emissions.</p>
<p>An important factor to acknowledge when discussing the pros and cons of electric vehicles is the lithium-ion batteries they have, which differ from batteries in traditional cars with gas engines because they must have a higher capacity for storing electricity. Lithium-ion batteries enable electric vehicles to store enough charge to drive relatively long distances, but in many ways, they come at a cost. Producing these batteries is incredibly resource-intensive and can have serious impacts on local and global environments. Mining and purifying lithium requires a lot of energy, much of which is generated through the combustion of fossil fuels; “ nearly 15 tonnes” of CO2 is produced “for every tonne of mined lithium” (Why Electric Cars Are Better for the Environment). Though many emissions are avoided by driving electric cars, which are more efficient than typical combustion engines, it is crucial to be aware of any negative impacts they may have on the environment. Additionally, lithium mining can have impacts other than just the emission of carbon dioxide, as it can adversely affect local ecosystems. Paying attention to environmental impacts outside of emissions is valuable because while measurements of GHGs are essential in monitoring global warming, other factors affect wildlife and habitats. Lithium mining can result in “water loss and contamination, ground destabilisation, and biodiversity loss,” which can have catastrophic impacts on nearby ecosystems (Why Electric Cars Are Better for the Environment). Both the GHGs emitted from the production of lithium batteries and changes to local ecosystems play a role in climate change, and examining all environmental factors is important when comparing gas-powered cars and electric cars. To decrease the environmental burden of electric vehicles, more attention should be paid to recycling these materials, especially as “[j]ust 5% of lithium-ion batteries are being recycled” as of 2021 (Why Electric Cars Are Better for the Environment). In addition, over “90% of cobalt and nickel” in these batteries “can be easily removed,” further emphasizing how problematic it is that recycling rates are so low. However, as technology has advanced, lithium mining and processing has been refined, and improvement will continue as time goes on (Why Electric Cars Are Better for the Environment). Though electric vehicles produce less GHGs on the road than engines that run on fossil fuels, consumers should be aware of the difference in effects they have on the environment during manufacturing as well. Being conscious of environmental impact during the entire lifespan of a vehicle is necessary to make an informed decision, and widespread attention on the negatives of lithium-ion batteries can catalyze improvements that make EVs an even better option.</p>
<p>EVs have their fair share of disadvantages when it comes to environmental footprint, but the amount of emissions avoided during transportation is a factor significant enough to support it as a choice superior to cars with internal combustion engines. Electric cars are vastly more efficient than gas cars because no energy is lost as heat and they have the ability to recycle energy usually lost when braking. However, the extent to how clean the electricity used by EVs is depends on how that electricity is generated, which varies from region to region. Nevertheless, electric cars’ higher efficiency beats out gas-powered cars regardless of the method used to generate the power they use. That being said, the lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles are resource-intensive to produce, which is important to consider when comparing environmental impact. Hopefully, as EVs become more prevalent, their sales will fund further research about producing these rechargeable batteries in a more efficient manner and with less waste. If GHG emissions aren’t controlled and skyrocket as they have been since the Industrial Revolution, there will be serious repercussions that devastate wildlife, agriculture, and the habitats of both humans and animals. Combating climate change is a responsibility that everyone bears, so investigating ways to decrease anthropogenic emissions is critical. Though they warrant improvement, electric vehicles are an alternative that can greatly reduce the emissions produced from transportation.</p>
<p>Can you tell this was an English assignment? I’m writing a three-part essay on EVs, with the first part on environmental impact and the following two on social impact and public reception. I debated on whether I should post the other two segments on this website, but I think that it’s relevant since it’s about technology that could decrease global emissions, and I think it’s important to know background details. So expect that in the near future! </p>
<p>I’ve been interested in looking into electric vehicles for a long time now, as I’ve heard a great deal of controversy about whether they’re actually good for the environment or not. Of course, much of the reason they are supported as an eco-friendly option is because they are, but I’ve heard the argument that the production of their batteries outweigh the advantages of avoiding the direct combustion of fossil fuels. Now I see that those concerns are substantial, but the amount of CO2 that EVs prevent from being emitted are more significant in the majority of cases. Of course, this depends on how much use the vehicles get, but electric vehicles are so vastly more efficient that in most practical applications, they are the superior choice. It wasn’t until writing this piece that I was able to fully understand why electric vehicles are better for the environment than normal gas cars, which is their efficiency. I feel like I learned a lot as I researched thermal efficiency, and my newfound comprehension can be used to explain the advantages of EVs to others, as well as applied to other concepts involved with energy. </p>
<p>Researching this topic has certainly contributed to my future decisions regarding electric vehicles, because although I obviously can’t afford one right now, when I buy cars in the future, I will research how electricity is generated in my area, and put that into consideration. I will now be much more likely to purchase an EV if the region I live in uses nuclear fission than if they burn coal, whereas I might not have taken that into account prior to this paper. I find proper education invaluable because it not only affects my decisions and therefore my carbon footprint, but also the knowledge of those around me, and their decisions as a result. Getting the facts straight about controversial topics is valuable, and I don’t think you should try to persuade others until you’ve properly researched a topic because you risk spreading misinformation. Of course, I think that having discussions prior to research with an open mind is good, because it shows you how much you don’t know, and you can consider opposing opinions, but the problem lies where people try to convince others that their opinion is right before fully learning the whole story. </p>
