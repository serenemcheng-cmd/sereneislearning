                <p>According to Our World In Data, “[a]round three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels for energy.” However, managing the impact of energy production must go beyond decreasing electricity usage, as energy plays a major role in individuals’ quality of life. Advocating for global reductions in energy usage simply isn’t realistic, as energy is needed for every aspect of daily life: transportation, keeping food fresh, communicating with others. Restricting energy use places discomfort on individuals and limits developing countries, so a better alternative must be sought.</p>
<p>Increasing energy efficiency can reduce emissions without requiring huge sacrifices, but a growing population and new technologies warrant a solution with a greater scale. Only one sixth of energy is generated through low-carbon methods, leaving much room for improvement. This is more possible now than ever, as advancements in technology have driven down renewable energy costs, with solar energy prices falling “by 85 percent between 2010 and 2020” (UN). In many parts of the globe, renewables are cheaper than fossil fuels, and further advancements are on the way. </p>

<p>Hydropower is the most prominent source of renewable energy, followed by nuclear, wind, solar, and other renewables. With growing emphasis on the climate crisis, new energy systems are under investigation, including nuclear and geothermal. As discussed last week, <a href="https://sereneislearning.wordpress.com/2025/01/05/what-is-fusion-and-how-can-we-use-it-serenes-synopsis-100/">fusion</a> energy is under development, but humans’ existing nuclear energy source, fission, has been gaining support in recent years as well. From 2016 to 2024, American support for nuclear energy rose from 43% to 56%, promoting growth in the industry (PEW). </p>
<p>Another growing field is geothermal energy, a method most people know about, yet currently it makes up almost none of global energy production. In 2022, geothermal energy contributed 92 TWh out of the total 29,925 TWh generated worldwide, a measly .31% (EIA, Statista). The concept is simple: the inner layers of the Earth are incredibly hot, mostly due to the radioactive decay of radioactive isotopes within the planet’s core. By accessing outlets of geothermal energy such as geothermal vents and geysers, humans can generate electricity without releasing any carbon. One type of geothermal energy, <a href="https://sereneislearning.wordpress.com/2023/07/16/superhot-rock-energy-serenes-synopsis-45/">superhot rock</a>, digs deeper to harness the Earth’s heat from any location, removing the need for particular and inconvenient placement. However, this form of energy is still in its developmental stages, and is far from commercial application.</p>
<p>Clean energy is so important because its potential reaches beyond decarbonizing the energy sector. Nuclear and renewables provide limitless, low-carbon energy that fosters growth, whether it be for developing countries or new technology. Projects like vertical farming aren’t currently feasible because of their energy demands, but building clean energy infrastructure can dramatically decrease the cost of energy and spur their progress. Clean energy is also valuable for adapting to new energy demands brought by technology like AI and phasing out emissions from other sectors. With the rising popularity of electric vehicles, clean energy sources are more important than ever, as they consume great amounts of electricity but stand to emit significantly less than their traditional counterparts. A supply of clean energy encourages the adoption of EVs, reducing emissions from the transportation sector.</p>
<p>Clean energy is one of the most efficient investments that can be made for society and the planet, as it will reduce our reliance on the main source of anthropogenic emissions. Additionally, this money is better spent on clean energy than something like planting trees, because although trees do consume CO2, when they decompose, much of that CO2 is returned to the atmosphere. </p>
<p>Although progress has been slow, the implications of a decarbonized energy sector are profound. This knowledge serves as a reminder to promote clean energy and divest in fossil fuels, whether it be through supporting charities like the Clean Air Task Force or revoking support from banks funding the fossil fuel industry. Individuals hold power through their voice and wallet, and as consumers, they have an obligation to wield it responsibly.</p>
<p>I had no idea that hydropower was the most significant contributor in renewable energy, or that geothermal was such a small source of our global energy. In the US, it’s a not much bigger, constituting around .4%, but it varies a lot by state. Only seven states even do geothermal, and it makes up 10.1% and 5.1% of the electricity generated in Nevada and California respectfully. I get that it depends on location, but I thought it would be a lot more prominent, especially since I learned about it in middle or elementary school. Hopefully we’ll see more advancements in the future, and maybe I’ll do a feature on geothermal in the future.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching a lot of Cleo Abram’s content on YouTube, and it has been so refreshing to see climate advocacy being promoted in such an optimistic and exciting light. As someone quite mentally consumed with the issues of the world, I can often be sucked into the despair of every situation. Something I wrote about in my college applications is the power of moderation, and how two extremes, ignoring climate change and being so consumed by it that you’re entirely hopeless, are both useless. I think optimism goes a long way in telling people about a problem without making them feel powerless, something I want to channel going forward, though I do think it is important to emphasize the gravity of these situations. </p>
<p>I made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14ndyNf8iks">a YouTube video</a> about my mosquito project for a scholarship a few months ago (that I do not expect to win, but I’m still really proud of it). I hadn’t seen much of Cleo’s content before making my video, but I feel like it channels a similar energy of excitement and intrigue. If you’ve seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6k7yBBhuZo">The Big Misconception About Clean Energy</a> video on Cleo’s channel, you’ll know this post was hugely inspired by it. Would definitely recommend checking out her YouTube channel and her other content on optimistic tech stories!</p>
<p>Anyway, hope you enjoyed this week’s article, and stay tuned to learn with me!</p>
